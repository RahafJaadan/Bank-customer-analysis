# Customer Churn Prediction for Bank Clients using Deep Learning 
This project aims to predict customer churn in a banking environment using **deep learning techniques**. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify which clients are likely to leave the bank and provide actionable insights so the bank can offer personalized retention offers to reduce churn.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking sector. This project utilizes customer data to develop a predictive model that identifies at-risk clients. The goal is to help the bank proactively engage with these customers by offering promotions or improved services to retain them. 

The project uses a deep learning model implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, along with data analysis and visualization tools to analyze customer behavior.

## Key Features 
* **Customer churn prediction**: Predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank based on their historical data.
* **Retention strategies**: Provide insights for offering retention strategies to at-risk customers.
* **Data visualization**: Gain a better understanding of customer behavior using various data analysis techniques and visualizations.

## Technologies Used
1. **Deep Learning Frameworks**:
* TensorFlow
* Keras 
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: 
* Pandas
* NumPy 
* Matplotlib 
* Seaborn

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this using the following commands:

  ```pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn ```

  ## Project Structure
  * data/ : Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. 
  * models/ : Includes the saved model architecture and weights.
  * notebooks/ : Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization, and model training.
  * scripts/ : Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
* Load and preprocess the dataset using pandas and numpy.
* Visualize important features using matplotlib and seaborn.
 2. **Model Training**:
* Build and train a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
* The model predicts customer churn based on the provided data.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
* Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
* Use confusion matrices and classification reports for detailed performance analysis.
4. **Retention Insights**:
* Based on the model’s predictions, determine which customers are likely to churn.
* Suggest retention strategies, such as offering personalized offers to at-risk clients.

## Dataset 
The dataset includes customer information, transaction history, and behavior patterns. Each record consists of various features such as: 
* Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location) 
* Account information (e.g., balance, number of products)
* Transaction history (e.g., activity levels, types of transactions) The target variable is a binary label indicating whether the customer has churned or not.
